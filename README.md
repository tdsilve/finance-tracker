# Personal Finance Tracker

## Main goal
The goal of this project is to build a Personal Finance Tracker that helps users manage their income and expenses while allowing me, as a frontend developer, to gain hands-on experience with backend development, including authentication, API design, and database management.

## Updating this project:

    -> Server:
        - Add typescript
        - Update node
        - Add login/auth 

    -> Front:
        - Change React to Next
        - Add Typescript
        - Improve code file system
        - Add login/auth

This application helps to manage the income and expenses of the user. The transactions are saved on the backend using a HTTP restful API.
